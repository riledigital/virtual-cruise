*The Sassybarbie, built in 2019 by the Royal Navy of Hyrule, is one of the fastest cruise ships of its class and holds the Guinness World Record in the fastest acceleration from 0 to 100mb/s. It is powered by 100% biodiesel and also houses a small facility for the care of dolphins. The Sassybarbie houses a world-class culinary staff, comprising of a French rat who makes a rad soup dish, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America who excels in making flooofy yet crunchy croissants, and a Japanese sushi chef who insists that he once cooked for Former President Barack Obama and boasts that he moonlights as a high-ELO competitive Yahtzee player when he is not expertly slicing up a mean sashimi platter for the guests of the Sassiebarbie. The Sassybarbie can hold up to a thousand crew members, and is also LEED-Platinum certified. In the event of a pirate invasion, the Sassybarbie attains 50% cooldown reduction, +100 Ability Power, +100 movement speed, and fires its main cannon hidden underneath the bow of the ship to deliver an exploding cannon shot that deals true damage equal to 100% of an enemy's HP. The ship can activate a shield that negates 50% of incoming damage.*
